     We have some bold companies in the [500 Global](https://www.linkedin.com/company/500global/) portfolio. The Atlas team is one of those.¬†Ruthless, when it comes to execution, fearless, laser-focused, and remarkably humble team: [[Michael Hoy üë®‚ÄçüöÄ](/in/michaelthoy/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAb0EAcBjVK3aL1GT685ViATT2MjEQaBQ6E)[[Clay Miner](/in/clay-miner-4b9b4a8/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAGXzk0B672tP_hFSzXcdNNnpxQzmjUgEGY)[[üë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄ Laura Liu Cruickshanks](/in/mslauraliu/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADL1vQB86M0EhUf5H8SN1JYJAABVwczE9U).  
     I had the privilege of working with them during the Flagship Accelerator Program [hashtag#myfavoriteBatch35](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23myfavoritebatch35&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED), and it‚Äôs been an absolute joy to support their journey.  
     Today, Atlas is launching on [Product Hunt](https://www.linkedin.com/company/producthunt/), introducing ‚Äúvibe pricing‚Äù‚Äîa fresh approach to SaaS monetization that‚Äôs already turning heads. If you‚Äôre curious about how AI can drive more profound customer discovery, value-based selling (even when the roadmap is still evolving!), and the future of SaaS metrics, you‚Äôll want to check this out.  
     Yesterday, Atlas hosted a Product Hunt launch party at [Pendo.io](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pendo-io/)' s SF office. The evening featured Atlas's customers and supporters, including:  
     [[Tatyana Mamut, PhD](/in/tmamut/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABw2IUBz0tX3bycfGNk3Ly2Nyf4id-jv7Y), [[Sam Werboff](/in/samwerboff/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAOWekcBRocJ4BvUt8ChEJ6eY3VWEMTjV8M), [[Shikhar Mishra](/in/mrmsra/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABLae8BmMlvxW450s9zFIqyInRBkovE-VM), and others.  
     As usual with the Atlas team, the room was full of great people, conversations about Taylor Swift (it's a long story- don't ask üòÅ ), and more good food.  
       
     Join us in supporting Atlas on Product Hunt‚Äîlet‚Äôs help them make some noise and show what the next wave of SaaS innovation looks like! üöÄ‚ú®

     Want to give a founder a mild panic attack?  
       
     Ask them for their EIN :)  
       
     "Wait... is it in that folder? Stripe Atlas? My bank account? That email from our lawyer three months ago?"  
       
     Trivial? Sure.  
       
     But multiply this by hundreds of similar moments:  
     \- Hunting for your registered agent info  
     \- Digging through state filing confirmations  
     \- Searching for your worker's comp policy number  
       
     And suddenly you're spending half your day on random admin work instead of building your company.  
       
     The worst part: it's such a pain.  
       
     This is exactly why founders love Central  
       
     Yes, we handle the big stuff like:  
     \- Payroll  
     \- Benefits  
     \- Government filings  
     \- Worker's comp  
     \- All that government mail  
       
     But there's so much more...  
       
     It's all the 1000 little things. The paper cuts.  
       
     The document searches.  
     The form hunting.  
     The quick edits.  
       
     All the moments that traditional HR/finance platforms ignore because they weren't built for founders like us.  
       
     Now possible, where you already are: SLACK.  
       
     Question: What's the administrative task you hate handling the most?

     Were you at Snowflake Summit last week? If so, you definitely saw the energy (and a bit of the chaos üëÄ) at the Group By() Lounge ‚Äî and we wouldn‚Äôt have had it any other way. üí•  
       
     From spontaneous whiteboard convos to packed demos and recruiting lines out the door, the Group By Lounge was the place to be for devs, data people, and open source enthusiasts.

From start to finish, your energy, creativity, and hustle were unmatched. Wouldn‚Äôt have been the same without you.

     Quitting my $850k/year job at 24 to build my own startup  
       
     DISCLAIMER: I think these kind of posts are cringe but my cofounders think it will do well and get traction üòõüòõ  
       
     Anyways, I always knew I'd start my own company someday. It was just a question of when and with whom. My original plan was simple: put in a few years at Palantir, reach my vesting cliff, then leave to build something of my own.  
       
     What I didn't anticipate was Palantir's stock exploding 15x since I joined in January 2023. The golden handcuffs suddenly became diamond at some point.  
       
     When [[Rajit Khanna](/in/rkhanna23/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA-inf8Be9MZb_BjTQ9viH0HPyAHFBVbV2k) called me up me earlier this year with an idea and a YC application, I casually said, "Sure why not, just throw my name on it and we'll see where it goes." Part of me even sadistically hoping that we wouldn‚Äôt get in. Funny enough, we did.  
       
     Suddenly I faced a genuine dilemma. Do I chase my entrepreneurial dreams with all the known risks, or continue working as an extremely over-compensated engineer in a secure role? Walking away from that kind of financial security at 24 isn't something you can do lightly. My mom is retiring this year and my brother Daniel still has a few years left in his little expensive liberal arts school (Princeton) with no financial aid. All of the financial pressure of mortgage, insurance, tuition, etc would fall on my dad. I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn't spend a few late nights staring at spreadsheets, calculating how much I owed the IRS, and questioning my own sanity.  
       
     But the entrepreneurial bug in me couldn't be ignored. Despite coding for long hours at Palantir during the week, I still found myself spending entire weekends building random apps and learning new tech. The opportunity in front of me was too compelling to pass up. I‚Äôd be working with two of my closest friends [[Land Tantichot](/in/landtantichot/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACQxqQkB01a1ocGeucMIrQduD4gTS02PiEE) and [[Rajit Khanna](/in/rkhanna23/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA-inf8Be9MZb_BjTQ9viH0HPyAHFBVbV2k), people who've seen me at my best and worst and who share my vision for what technology should do.  
       
     Our idea also has enormous potential, addressing a significant problem I personally have wrestled with both at Palantir and in my personal projects: poor product decisions that stem from a lack of understanding of how users actually interact with your product. If money was the only thing holding me back, then I realized I was never approaching startups for the right reasons to begin with.  
       
     So I decided to bet on myself.  
       
     I was watching Breaking Bad around the time I was making this decision and I was thinking I‚Äôd probably crash out like Walter White later in life if I had to watch Rajit and Land build a unicorn like Gray Matter without me.  
       
     For anyone contemplating a similar leap of faith, just do it. Some doors only open once.

         Hi Daniele, thanks for accepting the invite here!  
           
         I think I saw you briefly as I stopped by Toolhouse's booth at SNOW - really enjoyed learning about what you are building and I'd love to connect in the future over a call. I'm happy to provide more details on DTCP Growth / my interest in the space async or in a call. Wish you a good day there!  
           
         Feel free to book a time here if it makes sense. Thanks Daniele!

         Absolutely. We'd also go earlier stage (Series A) or I'm happy to chat / support conversations and intros with early-stage investors.  
           
         I frankly just want to stay close to the ecosystem and think that what you are doing is necessary in the stack.  
           
         For the meanwhile, I'd love to be added to your list + keep an open channel to connect!
